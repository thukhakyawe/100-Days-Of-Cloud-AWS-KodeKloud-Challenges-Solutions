As part of a data migration project, the team lead has tasked the team with migrating data from an existing S3 bucket to a new S3 bucket. The existing bucket contains a substantial amount of data that must be accurately transferred to the new bucket. The team is responsible for creating the new S3 bucket and ensuring that all data from the existing bucket is copied or synced to the new bucket completely and accurately. It is imperative to perform thorough verification steps to confirm that all data has been successfully transferred to the new bucket without any loss or corruption.

Create a New Private S3 Bucket: Name the bucket datacenter-sync-14788.

Data Migration: Migrate the entire data from the existing datacenter-s3-12806 bucket to the new datacenter-sync-14788 bucket.

Ensure Data Consistency: Ensure that both buckets have the same data.
