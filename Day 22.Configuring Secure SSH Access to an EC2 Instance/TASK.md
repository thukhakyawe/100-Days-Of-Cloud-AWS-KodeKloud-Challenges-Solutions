The Nautilus DevOps team needs to set up a new EC2 instance that can be accessed securely from their landing host (aws-client). The instance should be of type t2.micro and named devops-ec2. A new SSH key should be created on the aws-client host under the/root/.ssh/ folder, if it doesn't already exist. This key should then be added to the root user's authorised keys on the EC2 instance, allowing passwordless SSH access from the aws-client host.
